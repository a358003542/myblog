Examples
========


Listing the installed themes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With ``pelican-themes``, you can see the available themes by using the ``-l``
or ``--list`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pelican-themes -l
    notmyidea
    two-column@
    simple
    $ pelican-themes --list
    notmyidea
    two-column@
    simple

In this example, we can see there are three themes available: ``notmyidea``,
``simple``, and ``two-column``.

``two-column`` is prefixed with an ``@`` because this theme is not copied to
the Pelican theme path, but is instead just linked to it (see `Creating
symbolic links`_ for details about creating symbolic links).

Note that you can combine the ``--list`` option with the ``-v`` or
``--verbose`` option to get more verbose output, like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pelican-themes -v -l
    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pelican-2.6.0-py2.6.egg/pelican/themes/notmyidea
    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pelican-2.6.0-py2.6.egg/pelican/themes/two-column (symbolic link to `/home/skami/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/two-column')
    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pelican-2.6.0-py2.6.egg/pelican/themes/simple


Installing themes
"""""""""""""""""

You can install one or more themes using the ``-i`` or ``--install`` option.
This option takes as argument the path(s) of the theme(s) you want to install,
and can be combined with the verbose option:

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes --install ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/notmyidea-cms --verbose

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes --install ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/notmyidea-cms\
                               ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/martyalchin \
                               --verbose

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes -vi ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/two-column


Removing themes
"""""""""""""""

The ``pelican-themes`` command can also remove themes from the Pelican themes
path. The ``-r`` or ``--remove`` option takes as argument the name(s) of the
theme(s) you want to remove, and can be combined with the ``--verbose`` option.

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes --remove two-column

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes -r martyachin notmyidea-cmd -v





Creating symbolic links
"""""""""""""""""""""""

``pelican-themes`` can also install themes by creating symbolic links instead
of copying entire themes into the Pelican themes path.

To symbolically link a theme, you can use the ``-s`` or ``--symlink``, which
works exactly as the ``--install`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes --symlink ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/two-column

In this example, the ``two-column`` theme is now symbolically linked to the
Pelican themes path, so we can use it, but we can also modify it without having
to reinstall it after each modification.

This is useful for theme development:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pelican-themes -s ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/two-column
    $ pelican ~/Blog/content -o /tmp/out -t two-column
    $ firefox /tmp/out/index.html
    $ vim ~/Dev/Pelican/pelican-themes/two-column/static/css/main.css
    $ pelican ~/Blog/content -o /tmp/out -t two-column
    $ cp /tmp/bg.png ~/Dev/Pelican/pelican-themes/two-column/static/img/bg.png
    $ pelican ~/Blog/content -o /tmp/out -t two-column
    $ vim ~/Dev/Pelican/pelican-themes/two-column/templates/index.html
    $ pelican ~/Blog/content -o /tmp/out -t two-column



Doing several things at once
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``--install``, ``--remove`` and ``--symlink`` option are not mutually
exclusive, so you can combine them in the same command line to do more than one
operation at time, like this:


.. code-block:: console

    # pelican-themes --remove notmyidea-cms two-column \
                     --install ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/notmyidea-cms-fr \
                     --symlink ~/Dev/Python/pelican-themes/two-column \
                     --verbose

In this example, the theme ``notmyidea-cms`` is replaced by the theme
``notmyidea-cms-fr``
