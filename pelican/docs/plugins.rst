Plugins
#######

Beginning with version 3.0, Pelican supports plugins. Plugins are a way to add
features to Pelican without having to directly modify the Pelican core.

How to use plugins
==================

To load plugins, you have to specify them in your settings file. There are two
ways to do so. The first method is to specify strings with the path to the
callables::

    PLUGINS = ['package.myplugin',]

Alternatively, another method is to import them and add them to the list::

    from package import myplugin
    PLUGINS = [myplugin,]

.. note::

   When experimenting with different plugins (especially the ones that deal
   with metadata and content) caching may interfere and the changes may not be
   visible. In such cases disable caching with ``LOAD_CONTENT_CACHE = False``
   or use the ``--ignore-cache`` command-line switch.

If your plugins are not in an importable path, you can specify a list of paths
via the ``PLUGIN_PATHS`` setting. As shown in the following example, paths in
the ``PLUGIN_PATHS`` list can be absolute or relative to the settings file::

    PLUGIN_PATHS = ["plugins", "/srv/pelican/plugins"]
    PLUGINS = ["assets", "liquid_tags", "sitemap"]

Where to find plugins
=====================

We maintain a separate repository of plugins for people to share and use.
Please visit the `pelican-plugins`_ repository for a list of available plugins.

.. _pelican-plugins: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins

Please note that while we do our best to review and maintain these plugins,
they are submitted by the Pelican community and thus may have varying levels of
support and interoperability.

How to create plugins
=====================

Plugins are based on the concept of signals. Pelican sends signals, and plugins
subscribe to those signals. The list of signals are defined in a subsequent
section.

The only rule to follow for plugins is to define a ``register`` callable, in
which you map the signals to your plugin logic. Let's take a simple example::

    from pelican import signals

    def test(sender):
        print("{} initialized !!".format(sender))

    def register():
        signals.initialized.connect(test)

.. note::

    Signal receivers are weakly-referenced and thus must not be defined within
    your ``register`` callable or they will be garbage-collected before the
    signal is emitted.

List of signals
===============

Here is the list of currently implemented signals:

                                                                   so that removed articles are not leaked in categories or tags

=================================   ============================   ===========================================================================

.. warning::

   Avoid ``content_object_init`` signal if you intend to read ``summary`` or
   ``content`` properties of the content object. That combination can result in
   unresolved links when :ref:`ref-linking-to-internal-content` (see
   `pelican-plugins bug #314`_). Use ``_summary`` and ``_content`` properties
   instead, or, alternatively, run your plugin at a later stage (e.g.
   ``all_generators_finalized``).

.. note::

   After Pelican 3.2, signal names were standardized.  Older plugins may need
   to be updated to use the new names:

   ==========================  ===========================
   Old name                    New name
   ==========================  ===========================
   article_generate_context    article_generator_context
   article_generate_finalized  article_generator_finalized
   article_generate_preread    article_generator_preread
   pages_generate_context      page_generator_context
   pages_generate_preread      page_generator_preread
   pages_generator_finalized   page_generator_finalized
   pages_generator_init        page_generator_init
   static_generate_context     static_generator_context
   static_generate_preread     static_generator_preread
   ==========================  ===========================

Recipes
=======

We eventually realised some of the recipes to create plugins would be best
shared in the documentation somewhere, so here they are!

How to create a new reader
--------------------------

One thing you might want is to add support for your very own input format.
While it might make sense to add this feature in Pelican core, we wisely chose
to avoid this situation and instead have the different readers defined via
plugins.

The rationale behind this choice is mainly that plugins are really easy to
write and don't slow down Pelican itself when they're not active.

No more talking â€” here is an example::

    from pelican import signals
    from pelican.readers import BaseReader

    # Create a new reader class, inheriting from the pelican.reader.BaseReader
    class NewReader(BaseReader):
        enabled = True  # Yeah, you probably want that :-)

        # The list of file extensions you want this reader to match with.
        # If multiple readers were to use the same extension, the latest will
        # win (so the one you're defining here, most probably).
        file_extensions = ['yeah']

        # You need to have a read method, which takes a filename and returns
        # some content and the associated metadata.
        def read(self, filename):
            metadata = {'title': 'Oh yeah',
                        'category': 'Foo',
                        'date': '2012-12-01'}

            parsed = {}
            for key, value in metadata.items():
                parsed[key] = self.process_metadata(key, value)

            return "Some content", parsed

    def add_reader(readers):
        readers.reader_classes['yeah'] = NewReader

    # This is how pelican works.
    def register():
        signals.readers_init.connect(add_reader)


Adding a new generator
----------------------

Adding a new generator is also really easy. You might want to have a look at
:doc:`internals` for more information on how to create your own generator.

::

    def get_generators(pelican_object):
        # define a new generator here if you need to
        return MyGenerator

    def register():
        signals.get_generators.connect(get_generators)
