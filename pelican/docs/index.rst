Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python_. Highlights include:

  or Markdown_ formats
* Includes a simple CLI tool to (re)generate your site
* Easy to interface with distributed version control systems and web hooks
* Completely static output is easy to host anywhere

Features
--------

Pelican |version| currently supports:

* Articles (e.g., blog posts) and pages (e.g., "About", "Projects", "Contact")
* Comments, via an external service (Disqus). If you prefer to have more
  control over your comment data, self-hosted comments are another option.
  Check out the `Pelican Plugins`_ repository for more details.
* Theming support (themes are created using Jinja2_ templates)
* Publication of articles in multiple languages
* Atom/RSS feeds
* Code syntax highlighting
* Import from WordPress, Dotclear, or RSS feeds
* Integration with external tools: Twitter, Google Analytics, etc. (optional)
* Fast rebuild times thanks to content caching and selective output writing

Why the name "Pelican"?
-----------------------

"Pelican" is an anagram for *calepin*, which means "notebook" in French. ;)
